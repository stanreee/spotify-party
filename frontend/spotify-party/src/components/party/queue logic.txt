if the user is playing a song AND that song is at the top of the queue saved on the database, then
remove that song from the queue on the database, and queue up the next song


so say the database has the following songs on queue:

    Vacation
    SoulMate
    Call Me

and the user (host of the group) is currently playing Vacation (check by comparing track URIs), then remove Vacation from the queue on the database

    SoulMate
    Call Me

then send a request to spotify api to queue up SoulMate, meaning the next song played will be SoulMate and this would continue

this has a problem, there's no way for me to automatically check what the user is currently playing

plus this method is too convoluted and confusing


OR

any song that is entered on the website is just simply queued to the owner's spotify

problem is, there's no way for me to tell whether a song has finished playing or not



OR

just screw it all and instead just have queue history (have toasts whenever a member of the group queues a song)
