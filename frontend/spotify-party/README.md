# Overview

This project was created in order to practice my skills with React and building a full stack web application.

## How it works

The frontend was built with React. Backend server functionalities was built with Express and is maintained by Netlify Functions, which is responsible for communicating with the Spotify Web API to retrieve and handle Spotify user data like playlists, queueing songs, skipping songs, etc. 

Firebase is used as the primary database, which also handles user authentication, which is required for creating and managing parties. 

## How to use

Visit https://partify-it.netlify.app/ and login with your Spotify Premium account.

Users can join or create parties, where they can then queue up songs that will be added to the party owner's Spotify queue. Note that this only works if the owner has a Spotify premium account.
